# RADAR TimescaleDB Sink Connector and JDBC Connector

This project is based on Confluent's Kafka JDBC connector with additional functionalities, namely:

1. Support for `TimescaleDB` databases
2. Support for multiple `createTable` statements.
3. Support for schema creation and setting of schema name format in the connector config.
4. Support for `TIMESTAMPTZ` data type in `PostgreSQL` databases.

## Connect Single Message Transform

This project depends on a transform plugin that transforms the Kafka record before it is written to the database.
See [RADAR-base
/
kafka-connect-transform-keyvalue](https://github.com/RADAR-base/kafka-connect-transform-keyvalue) for more information.

If you're using Docker, the transform plugin image is included in the Dockerfile. If you're installing manually, the `kafka-connect-transform-keyvalue` plugin must be installed to your Confluent plugin path.

## TimescaleDB Sink Connector

### Installation

This repository relies on a recent version of docker and docker-compose as well as an installation
of Java 8 or later.

### Usage

Copy `docker/sink-timescale.properties.template` to `docker/sink-timescale.properties` and enter your database connection URL, username, and password.

Now you can run a full Kafka stack using

```shell
docker-compose up -d --build
```
